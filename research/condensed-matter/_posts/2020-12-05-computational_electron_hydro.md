Electron hydrodynamics is an interesting field that deals with an exotic regime in which electrons can be described by hydrodynamic equations.  I implemented a computer simulation to study the flow of these viscous electrons.

After this is the rest of the thing, including some $\LaTeX$ equations.

$$
 \begin{align}
    a &=\int_a^b (f(x))\  \d x \nonumber\\
    &= \pdv{}{r} \left( \sin(kx) \right) \nonumber\\
    &= \vui{x} \\
    &= \vbi{x} \\
    &= \vu{a} \\
    &= \vui{\beta}
 \end{align}
$$

And, I also wrote macros for writing some numbers typeset properly:

$$
 \begin{equation}
 \e ^ {\i x} = \cos x + \i \sin x
 \end{equation}
$$
