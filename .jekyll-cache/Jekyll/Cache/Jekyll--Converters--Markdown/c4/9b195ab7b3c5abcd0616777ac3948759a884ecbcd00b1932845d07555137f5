  <li><em>Supervised by Prof. Thomas Scaffidi &amp; Prof. Nicolas Grisouard</em></li>
  <li><em>Supported by a NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Electron hydrodynamics is an interesting field that deals with an exotic regime in which electrons can be described by hydrodynamic equations.  I implemented a computer simulation to study the flow of these viscous electrons.</p>
