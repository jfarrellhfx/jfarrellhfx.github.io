A couple years ago, I took an English course focused on graphic novels.  My final project was to create a comic book that was, itself, a visual essay studying another comic book, and I chose to write on one of the books we had studied, Alan Mooreâ€™s <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em>.  The result isâ€¦ not great,  but it was a lot of fun.  You can find it <a href="/assets/2018-03-20-Graphic-Novel-Essay.pdf">here</a>.</p>
