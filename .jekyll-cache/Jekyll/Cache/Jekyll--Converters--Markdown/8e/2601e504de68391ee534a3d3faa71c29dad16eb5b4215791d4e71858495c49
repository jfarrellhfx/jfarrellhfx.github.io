<p>Before we deal with the quantum case, it is a good idea to understand the theory of the harmonic crystal at a classical level.  The main idea is that we are going to suppose we have a crystal in its <em>equilibrium state</em> â€” that means there is no net force on any of the ions.  We can write the potential energy of the lattice as:</p>

<h2 id="the-thing">The Thing</h2>

<p>Take a function $f$, and let $g = f^{-1}$.  Then we can compute its derivative using:
\(f(g(x)) = x \\
\implies \dv{}{x}f(g(x)) = 1\\
\implies f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1\)
So that, remembering $g=f^{-1}$, we get:
\(\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inverse}
\boxed{g'(x) = \frac1{f\left(f^{-1}(x)\right)}.}
\end{equation}\)</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>

<p>You can use Eq. ($\ref{eq:inverse}$) this to work out the derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions.   As an example:
\(\begin{align}
\dv{}{x}\arccos x &amp;= \frac1{-\sin(\arccos(x))}, \nonumber\\
&amp;= \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}.
\end{align}\)</p>
