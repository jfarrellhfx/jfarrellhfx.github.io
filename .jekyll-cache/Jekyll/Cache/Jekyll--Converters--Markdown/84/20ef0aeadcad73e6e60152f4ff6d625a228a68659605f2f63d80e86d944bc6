<p>In very clean samples, electrons can flow like a liquid.  For <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07683" target="_blank"><em>Farrell, Grisouard, Scaffidi (2021)</em></a>, I used a finite-volume method to simulate a viscous electron gas flowing radially in a ring.  With certain boundary conditions, this setup experiences an instability: small perturbations to the steady state grow and oscillate at a certain frequency.  Depending on the length of the channel, this frequency can reach the range of TeraHertz, a region of the electromagnetic spectrum for which few good sources or detectors currently exist!</p>

<p>The figure shows the instabilityâ€™s growth rate and frequency as functions of the bias current in the radial direction.</p>
