<p>This long-form research documentary focuses on the controversy surrounding a commemorative statue of Edward Cornwallis, the man credited with founding the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.   His mistreatment of the Miâ€™kmaq indigenous population has been classified as genocide. The film was screened to a crowded house at Victoria College in the University of Toronto.</p>
