  <p>Each week I plot your equations dot for dot, xs against ys in all manner of algebraical relation, and every week they draw themselves as commonplace geometry, as if the world of forms were nothing but arcs and angles.  Godâ€™s truth, Septimus, if there is an equation for a curve like a bell, there must be an an equation for one like a bluebell, and if a bluebell, why not a rose?  Do we believe nature is written in numbers?</p>
