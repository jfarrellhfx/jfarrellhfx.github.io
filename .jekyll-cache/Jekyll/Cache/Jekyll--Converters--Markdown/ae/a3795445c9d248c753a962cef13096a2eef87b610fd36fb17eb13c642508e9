<p>Before we deal with the quantum case, it is a good idea to understand the theory of the harmonic crystal at a classical level.  The main idea is that we are going to suppose we have a crystal in its <em>equilibrium state</em> â€” that means there is no net force on any of the ions.  We can write the potential energy of the lattice as:</p>

<p>\(\begin{equation}
 V(\vbi{R})=\sum_{\vbi{R'}}
\end{equation}\)
\(f(g(x)) = x \\
\implies \dv{}{x}f(g(x)) = 1\\
\implies f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1\)
So that, remembering $g=f^{-1}$, we get:
\(\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inverse}
\boxed{g'(x) = \frac1{f\left(f^{-1}(x)\right)}.}
\end{equation}\)</p>
