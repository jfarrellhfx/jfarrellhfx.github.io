<p>Electron hydrodynamics is an interesting field that deals with an exotic regime in which electrons can be described by hydrodynamic equations.  I implemented a computer simulation to study the flow of these viscous electrons.</p>

<p>After this is the rest of the thing, including some $\LaTeX$ equations.</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\label{test}
\frac{\partial J}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
\end{equation}\]

<p>This was just  test of the thing.  The answer is in Eq. ($\ref{test}$).</p>

<p>Testing macro:</p>

<p>$\pfrac{1}{2}$</p>

\[\begin{equation} Test \end{equation}\]
