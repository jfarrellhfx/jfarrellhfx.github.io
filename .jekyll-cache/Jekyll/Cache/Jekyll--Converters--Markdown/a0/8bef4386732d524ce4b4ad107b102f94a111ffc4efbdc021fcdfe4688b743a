<p>My name is Jack Hollis Farrell, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying physics.  Mostly, I am interested in <em>Condensed Matter Physics</em>, the theoretical physics of materials â€” this wide field includes some of the theory behind Quantum Computers, Superconductors, and more.</p>

<p>I was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where I went to high school. In 2017, I moved to Toronto to start university, and I plan to graduate in June of 2021.</p>

<p>For detailed information, you can access my <a href="/assets/CV.pdf">full CV</a>.  If you donâ€™t need the exhaustive detail, find some highlights and news below!</p>

## More about Me
### Science
I am interested in *Condensed Matter Physics* on the theoretical side.  I got into physics in high school by reading lots of so-called "popular" books on the subject.  You can find a list of my favourites here.

### Filmmaking
 I've been making movies with my friends since around middle school.  For the past few years, in addition to my creative film projects, I have been exploring documentary and nonfiction filmmaking.  Lots of examples are on the <a href = "/film/">film</a> page.

### Other Interests
- *Comics:* I am a big fan of comic books and comic book movies.  There are lots of great stores in Toronto.  My "pull file" is set up at The Beguiling in toronto.  This is a great.  If you're interested for some reason, feel free to check out my (usually updated) list of books I'm following right now!
