<h2 id="math-and-physics-notes">Math and Physics Notes</h2>

<p>When I am trying to learn a concept, it helps a lot to write it out as if I am explaining it to myself.  These notes are part of that exercise.  Here, you can find pages (some more technical than others) on a variety of topics in mathematics and physics. The notes are consistently updated; they may (read: definitely) contain errors. <em>In most cases, you can also download a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdf</code> of the notes by by clicking a button at the end of each page</em>.</p>
