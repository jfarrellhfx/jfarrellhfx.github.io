<p>Let’s consider a system with only two degrees of freedom, which we’ll call $s_1$ and $s_2$.  They are <em>spins</em>, so they only take on the values $s = 1$ and $s = -1$.  To specify a system you just need to give values for $s_1$ and $s_2$.</p>

<p>Imagine the spins have magnetic moments of $\mu_B = 1$ (just so we don’t have to put it in).
\(\begin{equation}
 E(s) = -J s_1 s_2 - B(s_1+s_2).
\end{equation}\)
It comes from magnetic interactions — in certain units, the interactions between magnetic fipoles are given</p>
