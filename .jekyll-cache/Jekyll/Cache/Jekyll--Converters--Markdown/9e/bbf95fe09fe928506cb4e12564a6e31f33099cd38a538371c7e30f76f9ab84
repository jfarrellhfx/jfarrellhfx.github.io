<h2 id="classical-theory-of-the-harmonic-crystal">Classical Theory of the Harmonic Crystal</h2>
<p>Before we deal with the quantum case, it is a good idea to understand the theory of the harmonic crystal at a classical level.  The main idea is that we are going to suppose we have a crystal in its <em>equilibrium state</em> â€” that means there is no net force on any of the ions.  We can write the potential energy of the lattice as:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
 V(\vbi{R})=\sum_{\vbi{R'}} 
\end{equation}\]
