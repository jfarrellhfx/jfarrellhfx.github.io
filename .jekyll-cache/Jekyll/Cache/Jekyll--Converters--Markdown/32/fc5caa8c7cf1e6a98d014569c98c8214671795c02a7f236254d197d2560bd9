## Past Research Projects

I am interested in the theoretical physics of materials, called *Condensed Matter Physics*.  You can read about my recent research projects, in this area and others, below.

      <ul>
  <li><em>Supervisors: Prof. Thomas Scaffidi &amp; Prof. Nicolas Grisouard</em></li>
  <li><em>Supported by a NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In usual circumstances, collections of electrons moving in a solid do not experience hydrodynamic behaviour; any viscosity or convection is destroyed by strong scattering off of impurities in the crystal lattice or quantized lattice vibrations called “phonons”.  Still, in  materials like graphene, the length scale associated with this “momentum relaxing” scattering can be made large enough that hydrodynamic behaviour persists, meaning that the electron gas can be described by the Navier-Stokes Equations.</p>

<p>I used a finite-volume method to simulate a viscous electron gas moving in one dimension in a field effect transistor.  With certain boundary conditions, this setup experiences an instability: small perturbations to the steady state grow and oscillate at a certain frequency.  Depending on the length of the channe, this frequency can reach the range of TeraHertz, a region of the electromagnetic spectrum for which no good sources or detectors currently exist.</p>

  <li><em>Supported by a NSERC Undergraduate Summer Research Award</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Over the summer in 2019, I joined a team that was developing an infrared laser spectrometer to measure trace gases in the atmosphere.  It flew on a stratospheric balloon into the upper atmosphere.  We spent ten days in Timmins Ontario, preparing to launch the balloon.</p>
