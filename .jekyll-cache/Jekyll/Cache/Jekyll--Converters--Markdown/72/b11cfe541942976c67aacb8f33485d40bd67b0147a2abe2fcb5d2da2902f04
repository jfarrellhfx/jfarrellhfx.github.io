<p>Electron hydrodynamics is an interesting field that deals with an exotic regime in which electrons can be described by hydrodynamic equations.  I implemented a computer simulation to study the flow of these viscous electrons.</p>

<p>After this is the rest of the thing, including some $\LaTeX$ equations.</p>

\[\begin{align}
    a &amp;=\int_a^b (f(x))\  \d x \nonumber\\
    &amp;= \pdv{}{r} \left( \sin(kx) \right) \nonumber\\
    &amp;= \vui{x} \\
    &amp;= \vbi{x} \\
    &amp;= \vu{a} \\
    &amp;= \vui{\beta}
 \end{align}\]

<p>And, I also wrote macros for writing some numbers typeset properly:
\(\begin{equation} 
 \e ^ {\i x} = \cos x + \i \sin x
 \end{equation}\)</p>
