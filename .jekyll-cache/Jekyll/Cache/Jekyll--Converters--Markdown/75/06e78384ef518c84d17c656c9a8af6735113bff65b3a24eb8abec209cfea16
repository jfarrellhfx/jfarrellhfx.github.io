<p>Let’s consider a system with only two degrees of freedom, which we’ll call $s_1$ and $s_2$.  They are <em>spins</em>, so they only take on the values $s = 1$ and $s = -1$.  To specify a system you just need to give values for $s_1$ and $s_2$.</p>

<p>Imagine the spins have magnetic moments of $\mu_B = 1$ (just so we don’t have to put it in the formulas), and also imagine that there is a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$ along the same axis as the spins.  Then the energy has two parts — an interaction between the two spins, and an interaction between each spin and the external field:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
 E(s) = -J s_1 s_2 - B(s_1+s_2).
\end{equation}\]

<p>It’s useful to define some additional constants:</p>

<p>\(K = \beta J,\)
\(h = \beta B,\)</p>

<p>with $\beta= 1 / k_b T$ as usual.</p>

<p>To solve the problem, we’ll need to work out the partition function, which will be:</p>

\[\begin{align}
    Z &amp;= \e ^ {-\beta E(s_1,s_2)} \nonumber\\
      &amp;= \sum_{s_1,s_2} \e ^ {Ks_1s_2 + h (s_1 + s_2)}. \nonumber
\end{align}\]

<p>In this case, the sums over $s_1$ and $s_2$ are just over two values , $s_1 = 1$ and $s_2 = -1$.  So we get:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
    Z(K,h) = 2 \cosh(2 h) \e ^K + 2 \e^{-K}.
\end{equation}\]

<p>To get a sense of the physics, we’ll use the partition function to calculate some averages of quantities (I mean <em>thermal</em> averages).  For example, consider the (<em>spin</em>-averaged) magnetization, $M = (s_1 + s_2)/2$.  We take thermal average by working out:</p>

\[\begin{align}
    \langle M \rangle &amp;= \frac1Z \sum_{s_1,s_2} M \e^{-E(s)} \nonumber\\
    &amp;= \frac1Z \sum_{s_1,s_2}\frac12 (s_1 + s_2)\e^{Ks_1s_2+h(s_1+s_2)} \nonumber\\
\end{align}\]
