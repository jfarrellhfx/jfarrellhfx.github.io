<h2 id="math-and-physics-notes">Math and Physics Notes</h2>

<p>When I am trying to learn a concept, it helps a lot to write it out as if I am explaining it to myself.  These notes are part of that exercise.  Here, you can find pages (some more technical than others) on a variety of topics in mathematics and physics. The notes are consistently updated; they may (read: definitely) contain errors. <em>In most cases, you can also download a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdf</code> of the notes by by clicking a button at the end of each page</em>.</p>

    <p>This note explains how to take the derivative of an inverse function.</p>
<h2 id="the-thing">The Thing</h2>

<p>Take a function $f$, and let $g = f^{-1}$.  Then we can compute its derivative using:</p>

\[\begin{gather*}
f(g(x)) = x\\
\implies \dv{}{x}f(g(x)) = 1\\
\implies f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1.
\end{gather*}\]

<p>So that, remembering $g=f^{-1}$, we get:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inverse}
\boxed{g'(x) = \frac1{f\left(f^{-1}(x)\right)}.}
\end{equation}\]

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>

<p>You can use Eq. ($\ref{eq:inverse}$) this to work out the derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions.   As an example:
\(\begin{align}
\dv{}{x}\arccos x &amp;= \frac1{-\sin(\arccos(x))}, \nonumber\\
&amp;= \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}.
\end{align}\)</p>

<p>Make sure it is working ok:<br />
