<blockquote>
  <p>Each week I plot your equations dot for dot, <em>x</em>s against <em>y</em>s in all manner of algebraical relation, and every week they draw themselves as commonplace geometry, as if the world of forms were nothing but arcs and angles.  God‚Äôs truth, Septimus, if there is an equation for a curve like a bell, there must be an an equation for one like a bluebell, and if a bluebell, why not a rose?  Do we believe nature is written in numbers?</p>

<h1 id="more-about-me">More about Me</h1>
<h2 id="science">Science</h2>
<p>I am interested in <em>Condensed Matter Physics</em> on the theoretical side.  I got into physics in high school by reading lots of so-called ‚Äúpopular‚Äù books on the subject.  You can find a list of my favourites here.</p>

<h2 id="filmmaking">Filmmaking</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve been making movies with my friends since around middle school.  For the past few years, in addition to my creative film projects, I have been exploring documentary and nonfiction filmmaking.  Lots of examples are on the <a href="/film/">film</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="other-interests">Other Interests</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>Comics:</em> I am a big fan of comic books and comic book movies.  There are lots of great stores in Toronto.  My ‚Äúpull file‚Äù is set up at The Beguiling in toronto.  This is a great.  If you‚Äôre interested for some reason, feel free to check out my (usually updated) list of books I‚Äôm following right now!</li>
