<p>In usual circumstances, collections of electrons moving in a solid do not experience hydrodynamic behaviour; any viscosity or convection is destroyed by strong scattering off of impurities in the crystal lattice or quantized lattice vibrations called ‚Äúphonons‚Äù.  Still, in  materials like graphene, the length scale associated with this ‚Äúmomentum relaxing‚Äù scattering can be made large enough that hydrodynamic behaviour persists, meaning that the electron gas can be described by the Navier-Stokes Equations.</p>

<p>I used a finite-volume method to simulate a viscous electron gas moving in one dimension in a field effect transistor.  With certain boundary conditions, this setup experiences an instability: small perturbations to the steady state grow and oscillate at a certain frequency.  Depending on the length of the channe, this frequency can reach the range of TeraHertz, a region of the electromagnetic spectrum for which no good sources or detectors currently exist.</p>

</ul>

<p>Over the summer in 2019, I joined a team that was developing an infrared laser spectrometer to measure trace gases in the atmosphere.  It flew on a stratospheric balloon into the upper atmosphere.  We spent ten days in Timmins Ontario, preparing to launch the balloon.</p>

<h2 id="math-and-physics-notes">Math and Physics Notes</h2>

<p>When I am trying to learn a concept, it helps a lot to write it out as if I am explaining it to myself.  These notes are part of that exercise.  Here, you can find pages (some more technical than others) on a variety of topics in mathematics and physics. The notes are consistently updated; they may (read: definitely) contain errors. <em>In most cases, you can also download a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdf</code> of the notes by by clicking a button at the end of each page</em>.</p>
