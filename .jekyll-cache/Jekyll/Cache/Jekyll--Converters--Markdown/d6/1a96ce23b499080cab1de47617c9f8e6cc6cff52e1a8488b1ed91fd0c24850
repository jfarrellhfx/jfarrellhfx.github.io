<p>There are a few notations one uses pretty often in Quantum Field Theory.  One of them is Feynman’s “slash” notation:
\(\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:slash}
  \slash p \equiv \gamma^\mu  p_\mu \slash\partial
 \end{equation}\)</p>

<p>The notation used in Eq. \((\ref{eq:slash})\) was developed by Feynman</p>
