<p>Normal fluids like water and air are described by the famous <em>Navier-Stokes Equations</em>, which apply to any system that respects Galileo symmetry.  However, when the symmetry group is more exotic, novel terms may modify the NS equations and lead to interesting behaviour.  For <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12269" target="_blank"><em>Farrell, Huang, Lucas (2022)</em></a>, we investigated a fluid with the symmetry of a <em>helix</em>: only the combination $\ P_z + L_z/\xi\ $  is a conserved quantity, not  $\ P_z$   or  $\ L_z \ $ separately.  Interestingly, the transport coefficients of the helical theory are partially <em>fixed</em> by symmetry alone, and the fluid also features transverse responses, for example supplying a torque in the presence of a uniform electric field!</p>
