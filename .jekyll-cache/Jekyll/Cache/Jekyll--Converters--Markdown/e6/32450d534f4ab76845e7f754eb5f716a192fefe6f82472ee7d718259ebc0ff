I"q<p>My name is Jack Hollis Farrell, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying <em>physics</em>, <em>mathematics</em>, and <em>English</em>.
I was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where I went to high school.  In 2017, I moved to Toronto to start university.</p>

<p>For specifics, please consult my <a href="/assets/CV.pdf">full CV (pdf)</a>. If you don’t need the exhausting detail, find some highlights below:</p>

<h2 id="science">Science</h2>
<p>I am interested in <em>Condensed Matter Physics</em> on the theoretical side.  I got into physics in high school by reading lots of so-called “popular” books on the subject.  You can find a list of my favourites here.</p>

<h2 id="filmmaking">Filmmaking</h2>
<p>I’ve been making movies with my friends since around middle school.  For the past few years, in addition to my creative film projects, I have been exploring documentary and nonfiction filmmaking.  Lots of examples are on the <a href="/film/">film</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="other-interests">Other Interests</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>Comics:</em> I am a big fan of comic books and comic book movies.  There are lots of great stores in Toronto.  My “pull file” is set up at The Beguiling in toronto.  This is a great.  If you’re interested for some reason, feel free to check out my (usually updated) list of books I’m following right now!</li>
