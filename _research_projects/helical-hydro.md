Normal fluids like water and air are described by the famous *Navier-Stokes Equations*, which apply to any system that respects Galileo symmetry.  However, when the symmetry group is more exotic, novel terms may modify the NS equations and lead to interesting behaviour.  For <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12269" target = "_blank">*Farrell, Huang, Lucas (2022)*</a>, we investigated a fluid with the symmetry of a *helix*: only the combination $\ P_z + L_z/\xi\ $  is a conserved quantity, not  $\ P_z\$   or  $\ L_z \ $ separately.  Interestingly, the transport coefficients of the helical theory are partially *fixed* by symmetry alone, and the fluid also features transverse responses, for example supplying a torque in the presence of a uniform electric field!

The figure is a cartoon illustrating helical symmetry.
