## Classical Theory of the Harmonic Crystal
Before we deal with the quantum case, it is a good idea to understand the theory of the harmonic crystal at a classical level.  The main idea is that we are going to suppose we have a crystal in its *equilibrium state* --- that means there is no net force on any of the ions.  We can write the potential energy of the lattice as:

$$\begin{equation}
 V(\vbi{R})=\sum_{\vbi{R'}}
\end{equation}$$
