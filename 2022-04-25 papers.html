<h3>Spreading fronts of wetting liquid droplets: microscopic simulations and universal fluctuations</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10761v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10761v1</a>

We have used kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations of a lattice gas to study
front fluctuations in the spreading of a non-volatile liquid droplet onto a
solid substrate. Our results are consistent with a diffusive growth law for the
radius of the precursor layer, $R \sim t^{\delta}$, with $\delta \approx 1/2$
in all the conditions considered for temperature and substrate wettability, in
good agreement with previous studies. The fluctuations of the front exhibit
kinetic roughening properties with exponent values which depend on temperature
$T$, but become $T$-independent for sufficiently high $T$. Moreover, strong
evidences of intrinsic anomalous scaling have been found, characterized by
different values of the roughness exponent at short and large length scales.
Although such a behavior differs from the scaling properties of the
one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, the front
covariance and the probability distribution function of front fluctuations
found in our kMC simulations do display KPZ behavior, agreeing with simulations
of a continuum height equation proposed in this context. However, this equation
does not feature intrinsic anomalous scaling, at variance with the discrete
model.

<h3>The role of the thermodynamic factor on the intrinsic and tracer diffusivities in binary mixtures</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10726v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10726v1</a>

One of the Darken equations gives a relationship between the intrinsic and
the tracer diffusion coefficients, $D_A$ and $D_A^*$, of species $A$ in a solid
binary mixture. In its original version, the equation reads $D_A = D_A^*
\Gamma$, with $\Gamma$ the thermodynamic factor. The question addressed in this
paper is how $D_A$ and $D_A^*$ depend separately on $\Gamma$. Using a recent
result for transition probabilities in terms of the excess chemical potential
(M. Di Muro and M. Hoyuelos, Phys. Rev. E 104, 044104, 2021), it is shown that
the intrinsic diffusivity does not depend on $\Gamma$. This approach simplifies
a previous theoretical analysis that reaches the same result. Experimental
results of diffusion in a Ni-Pd and Fe-Pd alloys (M. J. H. van Dal et al., Acta
mater. 48, 385, 2000) are used to check the theory.
