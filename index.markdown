> I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John.

> Each week I plot your equations dot for dot, *x*s against *y*s in all manner of algebraical relation, and every week they draw themselves as commonplace geometry, as if the world of forms were nothing but arcs and angles.  Godâ€™s truth, Septimus, if there is an equation for a curve like a bell, there must be an an equation for one like a bluebell, and if a bluebell, why not a rose?  Do we believe nature is written in numbers?

# Welcome!
<img class = "responsive" src = "/assets/farrellJPG.jpg">

My name is Jack Hollis Farrell, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying *physics*, *mathematics*, and *English*.
I was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where I went to high school.  In 2017, I moved to Toronto to start university.


For specifics, please consult my [full CV (pdf)](/assets/CV.pdf). If you don't need the exhausting detail, find some highlights below.



# More about Me
## Science
I am interested in *Condensed Matter Physics* on the theoretical side.  I got into physics in high school by reading lots of so-called "popular" books on the subject.  You can find a list of my favourites here.

## Filmmaking
 I've been making movies with my friends since around middle school.  For the past few years, in addition to my creative film projects, I have been exploring documentary and nonfiction filmmaking.  Lots of examples are on the <a href = "/film/">film</a> page.

## Other Interests
- *Comics:* I am a big fan of comic books and comic book movies.  There are lots of great stores in Toronto.  My "pull file" is set up at The Beguiling in toronto.  This is a great.  If you're interested for some reason, feel free to check out my (usually updated) list of books I'm following right now!
