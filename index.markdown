<blockquote>Each week I plot your equations dot for dot, <i>x</i>s against <i>y</i>s in all manner of algebraical relation, and every week they draw themselves as commonplace geometry, as if the world of forms were nothing but arcs and angles.  Godâ€™s truth, Septimus, if there is an equation for a curve like a bell, there must be an an equation for one like a bluebell, and if a bluebell, why not a rose?  Do we believe nature is written in numbers?</blockquote>

# Welcome!
<img class = "responsive" src = "/assets/farrellJPG.JPG">
My name is Jack Hollis Farrell, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying physics.  Mostly, I am interested in *Condensed Matter Physics*, the theoretical physics of materials --- this wide field includes some of the theory behind Quantum Computers, Superconductors, and more.

I was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where I went to high school. In 2017, I moved to Toronto to start university, and I plan to graduate in June of 2021.

## More about Me
### Science
I am interested in *Condensed Matter Physics* on the theoretical side.  I got into physics in high school by reading lots of so-called "popular" books on the subject.  You can find a list of my favourites here.

### Filmmaking
 I've been making movies with my friends since around middle school.  For the past few years, in addition to my creative film projects, I have been exploring documentary and nonfiction filmmaking.  Lots of examples are on the <a href = "/film/">film</a> page.

### Other Interests
- *Comics:* I am a big fan of comic books and comic book movies.  There are lots of great stores in Toronto.  My "pull file" is set up at The Beguiling in toronto.  This is a great.  If you're interested for some reason, feel free to check out my (usually updated) list of books I'm following right now!
